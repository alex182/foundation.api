# Foundation.Api

## Description

This template uses .Net Core 3.1, to create a foundation for a standard CRUD API using the .Net Template Engine to create new projects on demand using `dotnet new`.

## Prerequisites

- VS2019 .Net Core Feature Set or .Net Core 3.1 SDK https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1

## ToDo

âœ… Basic Scaffold

âœ… Basic CRUD Operations

âœ… Add Fluent Validation

âœ… Add Custom Pagination

âœ… Add Sieve Filters and Sorting

âœ… Add Unit Tests

ðŸ”² Add Integration Tests

ðŸ”² Breakout Environments

ðŸ”² Logging

ðŸ”² Devops Pipeline

ðŸ”² Add CQRS Config

ðŸ”² Config File (i.e. CloudFormation script)

## First Time Template Installation

For your first time using this template, follow these steps to get things set up.

1. Clone this repository to your computer in an accessible location: `git clone https://github.com/pdevito3/foundation.api`
2. Open a command prompt to the folder directory at the root of the api template repo
3. Run the following command: `dotnet new -i .\`
4. Confirm the installation by running `dotnet new -l` 

## Using the Template to Create an API
Once a successful installation has completed, you can use the `dotnet new` command along with a few different parameters to create your project. 

### Parameters
* **Name**: `-n|--name` This is the name of your project. Generally, I do the company or app name, then the plural entity, then Api as a period separated name in Pascal Case (e.g. CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api)
* **EntityName**: `-e|--entity` This is the primary database entity that your API will be interacting with (e.g. Orders, OrderItems). **The parameter should be singular case and PascalCase (not camelCase)**.
* **EntityNameCamel**: `-en|--entitycamel` This should be the same as the EntityName parameter, but in camelCase and not PascalCase (e.g. orders, orderItems).
* **LambdaInitials**: `-la|--lambdainitials` This is the value that will be used in lambda expressions. Generally, this would be an all lowercase value that uses the first letter in each word of the entity name (e.g. o for orders, oi for OrderItems)

### Example Command for Creating an API for a Recipe Entity
```bash
Î» dotnet new foundation -n CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api -e "Recipe" -en "recipe" --la "r"
```

## Updating/Removing The Template
After your first use of the template, you'll want to make sure that you're using the most recent version. Unfortunately there isn't a smooth way to update the template after install. You must first manually remove the template and re-add it once again after retrieving the latest commit from this repository. This can be done using the `dotnet new -u [your repo dir]`, for example: `dotnet new -u "C:\Users\Paul\Documents\repos\Foundation.Api"` 

### Creating a New Project with an Updated Template
1. Pull the latest updates from the master remote.
2. Using the command prompt, `cd` to your your repository directory.
3. Run the uninstall script using `new`. Use `dotnet new -u [your repo dir]`. For example: `dotnet new -u "C:\Users\Paul\Documents\repos\Foundation.Api"`.
4. run `dotnet new -i .\` to reinstall the foundation template 
5. `cd` to the directory that you want to add your new repository
6. run `dotnet new foundation` as you normally would

#### Condensed Code For Using an Updated Template 
```bash
Î» cd "C:\Users\Paul\Documents\repos\Foundation.Api"

Î» dotnet new -u "C:\Users\Paul\Documents\repos\Foundation.Api"

Î» dotnet new -i .\

Î» cd..

Î» dotnet new foundation -n CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api -e "Recipe" -en "recipe" -la "r"
```

## Project Structure
There are three projects in this template. The below example illustrates an example for a `Recipe` entity in a project named `CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api`

* **CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api** 
  * Properties
    * **launchsettings.json**: the configurations available for launching the API from Visual Studio
  * Configuration
    * **RecipeProfile**: the mapping profiles for [automapper](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper) to easily map data between objects
  * Controllers
    * **RecipeController**: the actual endpoints that the API will expose for consumption
  * Data
    * Entities
      * **Recipe**: the class that we will use to represent the actual database table
    * **RecipeDbContext**: provides a reference for the database and tables that we will be working using throughout the project
  * Services
    * **IRecipeRepository**: a list of all of the methods we can use in our data access layer (DAL)
    * **RecipeRepository**: the actual implementation of each method in IRecipeRepository
  * Validators
    * **RecipeForCreationDtoValidator**: validation rules using [fluent validation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) when creating a new entity in the controller
    * **RecipeForUpdateDtoValidator**: validation rules using [fluent validation](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation) when updating an existing entity in the controller
    * **RecipeForManipulationDtoValidator**: validation rules that are *shared* between both the creation and update validators
* **CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api.Models**
  * Pagination
    * **PagedList**: a special type of `List` that captures pagination info with your collection (e.g. what page you are on, how big the page is, etc.)
    * **ResourceUriType**: minor enum used to capture the uri of the next and previous pages that our controller will use to provide additional pagination info when returning a list
    * **RecipePaginationParameters**: base parameters specific to pagination that our RecipeParametersDto can inherit when getting a list of entities
  * **RecipeDto**: the object we will use whenever we want to return a recipe externally
  * **RecipeForCreationDto**: the object we will expect to receive whenever someone is sending us a recipe to create
  * **RecipeForUpdateDto**: the object we will expect to use whenever someone wants to edit a recipe
  * **RecipeForManipulationDto**: the object that captures the shared parameters between both the creation and update DTOs
  * **RecipeParametersDto**: this object captures all of the parameters that we are able to receive when getting a list of entities (recipes)
* **CarbonKitchen.Recipes.Api.Tests**

## What to Do with a Generated Project

This template with scaffold out the bones of your project, but there are a few things you'll need to do to have it operate with you entity.

1. Update the parameters in the Entity and the DTOs
2. Update the validators to suit your needs
3. Adjust Sieve Filters and Sorts on the Entity
4. Update the QueryString search in the Repository Get List method to use whichever fields you'd like
5. Update unit tests for gets to accommodate filter and sorts
6. TBD
